    <h1><strong>Short Seek Time First </strong></h1>
    <p>In SSTF (Shortest Seek Time First), requests having shortest seek time are executed first.
        So, the seek time of every request is calculated in advance in the queue and then they are scheduled according to their calculated seek time.<br>
         As a result, the request near the disk arm will get executed first. SSTF is certainly an 
         improvement over FCFS as it decreases the average response time and increases the throughput of system.
          Let us understand this with the help of an example.</p><br>

          <h2><strong>Example: </strong></h2>

          <p>Suppose the order of request is- (82,170,43,140,24,16,190) <br>
           And current position of Read/Write head is : 50  <br>
           So, total seek time:

=(50-43)+(43-24)+(24-16)+(82-16)+(140-82)+(170-140)+(190-170) 
=208</p>

<h2><strong>Advantage:</strong></h2>
<ul>
    <li>Average Response Time decreases</li>
    <li>Throughput increases</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Disadvantage:</strong></h2>
<ul>
    <li>Overhead to calculate seek time in advance</li>
    <li>Can cause Starvation for a request if it has higher seek time as compared to incoming requests</li>
    <li>High variance of response time as SSTF favours only some requests</li>
</ul>
