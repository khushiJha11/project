    <h1><strong>Scan Algorithm:</strong></h1>
    <p>In SCAN algorithm the disk arm moves into a particular direction and services the requests coming in its path and after reaching the end of disk,
         it reverses its direction and again services the request arriving in its path. So, this algorithm works as an elevator and hence also known as elevator 
         algorithm. As a result, the requests at the midrange are serviced more and those arriving behind the disk arm will have to wait.</p><br>

         <h2><strong>Example:</strong></h2>
        <p> Suppose the requests to be addressed are-82,170,43,140,24,16,190.<br>
          And the Read/Write arm is at 50, and it is also given that the disk arm should move “towards the larger value”. <br>

          Therefore, the seek time is calculated as:

=(199-50)+(199-16) 
=332</p>

<h2><strong>Advantage:</strong></h2>
<ul>
    <li>High throughput</li>
     <li>  Low variance of response time</li> 
       <li> Average response time</li><br>

 <h2><strong>Disadvantage:</strong></h2>
       <li>Long waiting time for requests for locations just visited by disk arm</li>
</ul>
